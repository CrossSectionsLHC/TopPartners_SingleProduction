We consider the following simplified models to single B production (fixing \kappa):

- Singlet (BR approximatelly 50%:25%:25% to Wb:Zt:Ht)
- Doublet 1 (BR approximatelly 100% to Wt)
- Doublet 2 (BR approximatelly 50%:50% to Zt:Ht)

Four tables are in this folder, from where two are just for support:

- *TotalWidth_x_coupling_SingleT*: shows the total width for a range of kappa's values in each of the simplifyed models, so one can make sure that the choice of kappa for NWA interpretation indeed correcpond to the case in a definite mass range

- *Couplings_BR_SingleT_FW*: shows the couplings and branching ratios in each of the simplifyed models in the Finite Width case (for fixed Width/Mass ratio). This table is here just for curiosity, as for FW case we provide already the 2>4 cross section (including the B decay)

The PDF used is CTEQ6L (to be updated)
We use a minimal generation cut of ptj > 1 GeV , j = g,u,d,s,c
