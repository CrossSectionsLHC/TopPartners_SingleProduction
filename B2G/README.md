The cross section from Twiki:  https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/B2GVHF#NLO_cross_sections_for_single_T   as in 18 August 2023
For single production they are given for coupling = 1. For a different coupling, the cross section scales as coupling squared times a  nominal cross section (for c=1).
