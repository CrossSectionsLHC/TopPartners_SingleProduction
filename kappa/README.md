# Description of the scripts in this directory
## The scripts are all made for specific decay processes but can be easily modified with appropriate equations for other processes.
1.  `vlq_coupling.py` is a simple script to compute kappas for a given G/M of T->Ht decay.
2.  `vlq_kappa.py` prints out a table of kappas for Singlet B decays for a given set of G/M.
3.  `vlq_gamma.py` prints out a table of Gammas for Singlet B decays for a given set of kappa.
