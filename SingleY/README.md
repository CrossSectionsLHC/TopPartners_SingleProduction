We consider the following simplified models to single Y production (fixing \kappa):


- BR approximatelly 100% to Wt

Four tables are in this folder, from where two are just for support:

- *TotalWidth_x_coupling_SingleB*: shows the total width for a range of kappa's values in each of the simplifyed models, so one can make sure that the choice of kappa for NWA interpretation indeed correcpond to the case in a definite mass range

- *Couplings_BR_SingleB_FW*: shows the couplings and branching ratios in each of the simplifyed models in the Finite Width case (for fixed Width/Mass ratio). This table is here just for curiosity, as for FW case we provide already the 2>4 cross section (including the B decay)

The PDF used is CTEQ6L
The renormalisation and factorisation scales have been set on an event-by-event basis following the MG algorithm, 
and the systematics have been calculated varying the central value in the range 1/2 to 2.
We use a minimal generation cut of ptj > 1 GeV, where j = g,u,d,s,c
